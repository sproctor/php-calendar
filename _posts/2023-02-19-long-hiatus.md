It's been a very long time since PHP-Calendar has seen any significant changes. A few years ago I started a project
to improve both the UI and the code design. It never got to the point where it was releasable. Last year, I improved
on this a bit and started using Symfony. You can see the progress on the [v3.0 branch][v3-branch] on GitHub.

I think one of the biggest improvements is moving from my weird custom form library to Twig templates. I hope to make
things easier to read, understand, and contribute to. You'll need to let me know how I do.

The demo calendars are currently broken due to moving to the site to GitHub. I'll re-install them in a new location
soon. There's an open issue for this.

[v3-branch]: https://github.com/sproctor/php-calendar/tree/v3.0
